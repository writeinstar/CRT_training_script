# Exercise 9 - Test Execution (parameters)!

Welcome to **Exercise 9**. Everything you need to know to run your tests and organize your tests.

# Purpose

The purpose of this exercise is to learn how to run (groups of) tests with Copado Robotic Testing.

# Prerequisite(s)

- Access to a Copado Robotic Testing Organization is required
- Access to a Project
- Robot created

# Learning Objectives

- Understand Test Suites (files and directories)
- Differentiate Development from Regression executions
- Using Tags and tag patterns
- Execution parameters (test name, tags, or suites)

# Understand Test Suites (files and directories)

1. Create a new empty suite **exercise 9 test execution parameters**

2. Create a folder in the root named **exercise-9-test-execution-parameters**

3. In folder **exercise-9-test-execution-parameters**, create a new folder named **US-00001**

4. In folder **US-00001**, create file US-00001.robot and copy the contents from here [US-00001.robot](https://bitbucket.org/copado-robotic-testing/training-exercises/raw/50a73e34b4a5a70df04463af665d8213d1278604/exercise-9-test-execution-parameters/US-00001/US-00001.robot)

4. In folder **exercise-9-test-execution-parameters**, create a new folder named **regression**

5. In folder **regression**, create file accounts.robot and copy the contents from here [accounts.robot](https://bitbucket.org/copado-robotic-testing/training-exercises/raw/e192ef391cfce07ce872a5e9757e50d783e79ee9/exercise-9-test-execution-parameters/regression/accounts.robot)

6. In folder **regression**, create file leads.robot and copy the contents from here [leads.robot](https://bitbucket.org/copado-robotic-testing/training-exercises/raw/e192ef391cfce07ce872a5e9757e50d783e79ee9/exercise-9-test-execution-parameters/regression/leads.robot)

7. In folder **regression**, create a new folder named **nested**

8. In this **nested** folder, create file opportunities.robot and copy the contents from here [opportunities.robot](https://bitbucket.org/copado-robotic-testing/training-exercises/raw/50a73e34b4a5a70df04463af665d8213d1278604/exercise-9-test-execution-parameters/regression/nested/opportunities.robot)


# Differentiate Development from Regression executions

1. In the folder **exercise-2-consulting-libraries**, open file libraries.robot

2. Check out the QWord Palette and identify libraries and keywords out of the box.
