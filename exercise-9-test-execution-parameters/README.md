# Exercise 9 - Test Execution (parameters)!

Welcome to **Exercise 9**. Everything you need to know to run your tests and organize your tests.

# Purpose

The purpose of this exercise is to learn how to run (groups of) tests with Copado Robotic Testing.

# Prerequisite(s)

- Access to a Copado Robotic Testing Organization is required
- Access to a Project
- Robot created

# Learning Objectives

- Differentiate Development from Regression executions
- Understand Test Suites (files and directories)
- Using Tags and tag patterns
- Execution parameters (test name, tags, or suites)

# Differentiate Development from Regression executions

1. Create a new empty suite **exercise 9 test execution parameters**

2. Create a folder in the root named **exercise-9-test-execution-parameters**

3. In this folder, create a new folder named **regression**

3. In this folder, create file libraries.robot and copy the contents from here [libaries.robot](https://bitbucket.org/copado-robotic-testing/training-exercises/raw/582f5c6ce20adf223d58b2f12f3b97073e7f93c0/exercise-2-consulting-libraries/libraries.robot)

4. Use Big Live Test button and run step by step test case Consult Libraries

# Understand Test Suites (files and directories)

1. In the folder **exercise-2-consulting-libraries**, open file libraries.robot

2. Check out the QWord Palette and identify libraries and keywords out of the box.

# Using Tags and tag patterns

# Execution parameters (test name, tags, or suites)
